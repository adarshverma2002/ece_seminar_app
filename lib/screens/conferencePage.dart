The templates are available at the link: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html. The paper selection will follow a double-blind review process, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous during the paper selection process. Do NOT include any authorsâ€™ information such as name, affiliation, e-mail, etc. in the initial manuscript. All accepted and registered papers will be published in proceedings (Abstract Book) of RAEEUCCI 2023. The presented full-length papers will be submitted to IEEE Xplore Digital Library. The final decision for publishing an article is subject to meeting the quality requirement of IEEE. Plagiarism level (Similarity Index) of the manuscript must be less than 10% at any stage; otherwise, the articles will be rejected outright by the publisher. As a general rule we would advise that an author does not submit more than two articles to a conference. This includes papers that they have coauthored. There is no extra charge for publications.',
